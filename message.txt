The Indian Food Composition Tables 2017 provides nutritional information on 151 discrete food components for 528 key foods. IFCT provides data of regular nutrients in foods complete in all respect and also on a whole range of bioactive substances. Vitamin D2 content in plant foods is presented for the first time in the world. The tables contain data on oligosaccharides, phytosterols, organic acids and individual polyphenols. It also embodies an exhaustive database on amino acid and fatty acid profiles of various foods. Except for eggs, all other food component data are for foods in the raw form.
