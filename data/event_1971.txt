In a relatively short duration between 1964 and 1970 there was very little probability for the alteration in the nutritive value of Indian foods. The dietary pattern remained similar despite economic growth, probably due to concomitant population expansion, low income and inadequate food supply (Rao, 1967). A slight upward trend was noted in the consumption of foods from animal sources, fats, sugars while a slight decline was noticed in the intakes of vegetables and food grains. Yet, diets were found to be inadequate in protein, vitamin A, calcium, iron, energy, ascorbic acid, thiamine and riboflavin according to Nutritional Advisory Committee (NAC) of the ICMR (Devadas et al., 1965). The Indian population continued to thrive on subsistence vegetarian diets with little or no milk. These dietetic and nutritional factors were considered while revising the FCT. Subsequently, a consolidated FCT entitled ‘Nutritive Value of Indian Foods’ was released by Gopalan, Ramasastri, and Balasubramanian (1971). The phrase ‘Planning of Satisfactory Diets’ was excluded from the title probably due to increase in consumer options triggered by economic growth.

Apart from inadequate dietary iron intake, the incidence of IDA was additionally ascribed to impair iron absorption leading to metabolic deficit due to preference for cereal rather than iron rich foods (Venkatachalam, 1968). Protein energy malnutrition (PEM) in the forms of Kwashiorkor (protein and calorie deficiency) and marasmus (calorie deficiency) were evident among children and were regarded as the most prevalent and widespread nutritional problems in India during those days (Gopalan, 1970). Nutritional hypertension observed among Indian population was at that time ascribed to the differential proportion of long chain versus short chain fatty acids in the fats and oils consumed (Malhotra, 1970).
