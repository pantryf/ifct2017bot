Economic liberalization and globalization changed the food and nutrition scenario in India. Between 1990 and 2010, the daily per capita supply of energy, protein and fat increased by 11, 12 and 30%, respectively. Consumption of fruits, starchy roots, vegetables increased by 91, 52 and 46%, respectively (Food and Agriculture Organization Statistics, FAOSTAT, 2013), though a steady increase in the food price was also observed. A change in dietary pattern was observed as the conventional diet of the Indian populations shifted largely due to the modified food supply systems. Reduction in incidence of kwashiorkor from 0.2 to 0% and bitotâ€™s spot from 0.7 to 0.2%, respectively among pre-school children (NNMB, 2012) was noticed. However, new public health issues emerged. The risk factors of overweight increased to 11.8 and 15.5% in men and women, respectively (NNMB, 2012). Prevalence of child malnourishment at 45.9% (National Family Health Survey NFHS-3, 2006), any anemia at 79% among 6-35 month children (NFHS-3, 2007), underweight among women at 35.6% women (NFHS-3, 2007), anemia at 55.3% among women of 15 to 49 years of age (NFHS-3, 2006), diabetes at 8.63% (International Diabetes Federation IDF, 2014), hypertension at 22.2% in men and 21.6% in women (NNMB, 2012) came to be matters of new public health concern.
