Between 1938 and 1951, there was a notable transition in the Indian nutrition scenario. Among tropical regions, India contributed substantially in the field of nutrition (Nicholls, 1945). The incidence of pellagra was noticed and the role of niacin in its cure was successfully demonstrated in India (Raman, 1940; Aykroyd & Swaminathan, 1940). The agricultural practices in India also underwent modifications with concomitant increase in the crop yields. However, the basic diet of individuals remained inadequate, devoid of animal fats and proteins, due to poor economic conditions (Day, 1944). The translation of nutrition research into sustained public health was hindered by obstacles of weak economy, ignorance and poverty (Aykroyd, 1941). Other deficiency diseases such as maternal anaemia, infant beriberi and osteomalacia continued to be rampant. Sustained nutritional issues prompted the revision of Indian FCT resulting in the publication of fourth edition of the Health Bulletin No. 23 by Aykroyd, Patwardhan, and Ranganathan (1951).
