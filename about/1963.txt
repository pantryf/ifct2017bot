In the subsequent years between 1952 and 1962, growth in nutrition oriented research in India took place even while deficiency disorders continued to be widespread. The diets predominantly comprised of cereals, small quantities of pulses, green vegetables and lesser proportion of milk, meat and eggs. Protein malnutrition was of considerable magnitude particularly among the poor communities (Rao, Swaminathan, Swarup, & Patwardhan,1959). Incidence of kwashiorkor and marasmus were observed across India (Gopalan & Ramalingaswami, 1955). Scientific articles around this time elucidated the role of amino acids in regulation of human health. Pellagra was reportedly instigated by amino acid imbalance of the sorghum diet, due to relatively excess leucine intake (Gopalan, 1961). Additionally, it was reported that the BV of proteins may not be limited by single amino acid but could be due to combined effects of partial amino acid deficiencies (Patwardhan, 1956). Among micronutrient deficiencies, iron deficiency anemia (IDA) was observed more among rural sections of populations while kwashiorkor occurred throughout India (Patwardhan, 1961). It was found that the prevalence of IDA was greater in India when compared to Europe due to excessive phosphorus and phytic acid with concomitant low calcium levels in the diet. About 16% of population had less than 8 g/100 dl mean blood haemoglobin level while the daily intake of iron among Indian populations ranged from 12 to 40 mg (Foy & Kondi, 1957). The occurrence of IDA was therefore observed to be not exclusively limited to the low iron intake from the diets but was also attributed to poor gastrointestinal absorption, inhibition of iron uptake by other dietary components or even the loss of absorbed iron.
