The green revolution ushered in food security and there was a substantial decrease in the levels of poverty in India. After 1971, the status of nutritional deficiencies was observed to have improved with the reduction in the prevalence of IDA, vitamin A deficiency (VAD) and child malnutrition except the incidence of goitre which had escalated. Between 1971 and 1974, the prevalence of corneal disease (vitamin A deficiency) accounted for about 2% of the cases of blindness in India (Reddy, Shekar, Rao, & Gillespie, 1992). Between 1975 and 1990, there was a decline in clinical deficiency signs of VAD among children of 1 to 5 years in rural areas (National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau, NNMB Report, 1991). The prevalence of marasmus and kwashiorkor also decreased from 1.3 to 0.6 % and 0.4 to 0.1%, respectively. However, chronic diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular health became matters of public health concern.
