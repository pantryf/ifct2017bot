The new ‘Indian Food Composition Tables, 2017’, provides nutritional information on 151 discrete food components for 528 key foods. All data presented in this book originate from regional composite samples averaged for six geographical regions of the country. The voluminous food composition data of unprecedented analytical quality is statistically representative of both the national food supply and consumption pattern. The standard deviation of each component data point represents the overall variability within.

No data in this book has been borrowed or derived from other data sources and represents accurate nutritional information of foods that are consumed across the country. The data are of reasonable representation of year round nationwide means and fit for assessment of nutrient intakes and their impact on health of the population.

Except for eggs, all other food component data are for foods in the raw form. Food being a biological matter exhibits variations in chemical composition due to multiple factors. This is particularly true for labile nutrients like vitamins and variations are imminent due to food processing. These limitations of the FCT need to be understood by the users.
